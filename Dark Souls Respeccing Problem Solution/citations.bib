 abstract = {In calculus texts, the average of a function and the mean value theorem for integrals are presented and motivated for single-valued integrals. For other integrals theyâ€™re only stated. Line and surface integrals can be reduced to single and double integrals, respectively, and typically that is how they are evaluated. It is no wonder then that the mean value theorem applies to the parameterized versions. This is all well-known. However, in no calculus text have we seen the details. This note provides the missing details.},
